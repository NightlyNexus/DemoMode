Demo Mode
=====================

Control Android's Demo Mode from your app.

Puts the Demo Mode controls into an understandable API to use for debugging or in screenshot apps.
<br/>Sending Demo Mode broadcasts is as easy as
<br/>`sendBroadcast(new NotificationsBuilder().visible(false).build())`.

Get a [`DemoModeInitializer`](demomode/src/main/java/com/nightlynexus/demomode/DemoModeInitializer.java) via `DemoMode.initializer(Context)` to handle granting permissions from an app.

Why?
--------

Android (Mashmallow and above) has a SystemUI Tuner. Users can find it in the device Settings app, developers can send the corresponding broadcasts from the adb shell, but applications need the [system-signed DUMP permission](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646/core/res/AndroidManifest.xml#2085) to send these broadcasts.

The [documentation on Demo Mode](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646/packages/SystemUI/docs/demo_mode.md) is unclear what extras should be sent with the broadcasts and is wrong in some places. (For example, the ["sync" and "eri" icons](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/tuner/DemoModeFragment.java#42) cannot currently be changed by the [broadcasts](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/statusbar/phone/DemoStatusIcons.java#61).)

This library seeks to make Demo Mode easier to use in applications by handling permissions and wrapping the implementation of creating the broadcast Intents in an understandable and working API.

The current implementation of this library is based off [AOSP commit b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646).

The relevant implementation code that receives the broadcast is in [`DemoMode`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/DemoMode.java), [`BatteryControllerImpl`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/statusbar/policy/BatteryControllerImpl.java), [`NetworkControllerImpl`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/statusbar/policy/NetworkControllerImpl.java), [`PhoneStatusBar`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/statusbar/phone/PhoneStatusBar.java), [`DemoStatusIcons`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/statusbar/phone/DemoStatusIcons.java), and [`Clock`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b8f0e69ef087798b46447a7352461a5120186646/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/statusbar/policy/Clock.java).
